# AB3DMOT

A Python implementation of a 3D multi-object tracking pipeline based on Kalman Filter and Hungarian assignment, applied to the KITTI tracking dataset. This repository contains code for 3D tracking, association, evaluation, and visualization in Bird‚Äôs Eye View (BEV).

## üìù Usage

### Run Tracking on KITTI Sequences

- Saves tracking results to `output/`
- Visualizes tracking in BEV using `matplotlib`

---

### Convert KITTI Labels to Tracking Format

```bash
python Kitti2trackers_converter.py
```

- Converts KITTI label files to the tracking ground truth format.
- Outputs are saved in `converted_gt_tracks/`

---

### Evaluate Tracking Performance

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

- Computes MOT metrics on ground truth and predicted tracks.
- Outputs detailed MOTChallenge metrics summary.
